This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Rabies cases in Israel, utilizing data obtained from the official data.gov.il API. The dataset encompasses various attributes including species affected, geographical locations, dates of events, and more.

Key steps undertaken in the project include:

Data Acquisition: Fetching records from the data.gov.il API to compile a complete dataset of Rabies cases.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis, which involved setting primary keys, converting date formats, and removing redundant or irrelevant columns.
Data Exploration: Conducting an initial examination of the data to understand its structure, contents, and to identify any immediate patterns or anomalies.
Data Visualization: Creating a series of visualizations to illustrate the distribution of Rabies cases by species, region, and time. This included count plots, bar plots, and heatmaps to reveal trends and patterns in the data.
The analysis revealed several key insights:

Dogs and jackals are the most frequently reported species with Rabies, likely due to their proximity to human habitats and behaviors that increase their risk of exposure to the virus.
The Galil and Golan regions reported the highest number of Rabies cases, possibly due to their rural landscapes and wildlife reservoirs.
Seasonal trends were observed, with higher numbers of cases reported in the colder months, which may be related to animal breeding seasons, changes in behavior, and environmental factors that affect virus survival.
Visualizations for the year 2023 were also created to compare the current year's data against the historical average, providing a current perspective on the Rabies situation.

The findings from this project could be instrumental for public health officials and policymakers in enhancing Rabies surveillance, control measures, and public awareness campaigns, particularly in high-risk areas and periods identified through the analysis.
