# Rabies Project

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Rabies cases in Israel, utilizing data from the official data.gov.il API. 
The dataset encompasses various attributes including species affected, geographical locations, dates of events, and more.
This project uses Jupyter Book hosted on GitHub Pages. It includes Jupyter Notebooks, custom assets, and automated deployment.

### Key steps undertaken in the project include:

  Data Acquisition: Fetching records from the data.gov.il API to compile a complete dataset of Rabies cases.

  Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis, which involved setting primary keys, converting date formats, and removing redundant or irrelevant columns.

  Data Exploration: Conducting an initial examination of the data to understand its structure, contents, and to identify any immediate patterns or anomalies.

  Data Visualization: Creating a series of visualizations to illustrate the distribution of Rabies cases by species, region, and time. This included count plots, bar plots, and heatmaps to reveal trends and patterns in the data.

### The analysis revealed several key insights:

1. Dogs and jackals are the most frequently reported species with Rabies, likely due to their proximity to human habitats and behaviors that increase their risk of exposure to the virus.
2. The Galil and Golan regions reported the highest number of Rabies cases, possibly due to their rural landscapes and wildlife reservoirs.
3. Seasonal trends were observed, with higher numbers of cases reported in the colder months, which may be related to animal breeding seasons, changes in behavior, and environmental factors that affect virus survival.
4. Visualizations for the year 2023 were also created to compare the current year's data against the historical average, providing a current perspective on the Rabies situation.

The findings from this project could be instrumental for public health officials and policymakers in enhancing Rabies surveillance, control measures, and public awareness campaigns, particularly in high-risk areas and periods identified through the analysis.

### General Takeaways from the Rabies Events Analysis Project
##### Species-Specific Trends:

High-Risk Species: Dogs and jackals are the most frequently affected species by rabies, with dogs having the highest count of 1022 events, followed by jackals with 710 events. This highlights the need for focused rabies control measures, including vaccination and public awareness campaigns, particularly targeting these species.

Moderate to Low Incidence: Other species such as cattle, foxes, and sheep also show considerable rabies events but to a lesser extent. Rarely affected species like cows and mongooses suggest varying levels of risk among different animals.

##### Regional Variations:
High-Risk Regions: The Galil Golan and Amakim regions have the highest counts of rabies events, with 1419 and 801 events respectively. This indicates a higher risk and possibly greater challenges in controlling rabies in these regions.

Low Incidence Regions: Regions like Hasharon, Negev, and Shfela Vahar show significantly lower rabies events, suggesting effective control measures or lower transmission rates in these areas.

##### Temporal Trends:
Yearly Peaks: The data reveals significant peaks in certain years, notably in 2009 and 2017. These peaks might indicate rabies outbreaks or heightened periods of transmission that require further investigation.

Recent Decline: A noticeable decline in rabies events is seen in the years following 2018, indicating possible improvements in control measures or changes in environmental or social factors affecting rabies transmission.

##### Seasonal Patterns:
Fall Peaks: There is a clear seasonal trend with higher rabies events in the fall, particularly in October and November. This suggests that rabies transmission might be influenced by seasonal factors such as animal behavior and environmental conditions.

Mid-Year Lows: The mid-year months of June and July show the lowest incidence, indicating periods of lower transmission or effective seasonal control measures.

##### Recent Year Comparison:
2023 Trends: The year 2023 has shown significantly lower rabies events across all months compared to the annual averages. This indicates that 2023 has been an unusually low year for rabies incidents, possibly due to effective control strategies or other favorable conditions.

##### Recommendations
Focused Vaccination Programs: Enhance rabies vaccination campaigns targeting high-risk species such as dogs and jackals, especially in high-incidence regions like Galil Golan and Amakim.

Seasonal Preparedness: Implement intensified rabies control measures and public awareness campaigns leading up to and during the fall months to mitigate the higher transmission rates observed during this period.

Continuous Monitoring: Maintain vigilant monitoring and reporting systems to promptly detect and respond to any potential outbreaks, particularly in regions and species identified as high-risk.

Investigation of Effective Measures: Further investigate the specific control measures or conditions that led to the significant reduction in rabies events in 2023 to replicate these strategies in future years.

Regional Adaptation: Customize rabies control strategies to fit the unique needs and challenges of different regions, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively based on regional risk assessments.
